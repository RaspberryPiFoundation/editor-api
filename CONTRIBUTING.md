# Contributor guidelines for the Code Editor

## 1. What is the Code Editor from the Raspberry Pi Foundation?

The [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/) is a UK-based charity with global reach. Our mission is to enable young people to realise their full potential through the power of computing and digital technologies.

To support young people to learn how to code, in both formal and informal education settings, we’ve designed our [Code Editor][production] to support text-based programming languages, including Python, CSS, and HTML.

## 2. Latest versioning and future releases

The Code Editor from the Raspberry Pi Foundation is currently in beta. This means there may still be some issues and bugs which we’ll be working on fixing, and where contributors identify particularly useful features, we may consider implementing them. 

Our current priority is extending the functionality so that it supports young people to learn to code.

As this project is in its infancy, we encourage contributors to check this documentation from time to time, as we refine our processes and update you on our roadmap changes.

**Q3 2023 (July-Sep) priority features:**
- Beta testing and iterating based on user feedback (i.e. the young people using our Code Editor)
- Building better support for smaller screen devices (tablet and mobile responsiveness)
- Linting and static error analysis

You can track our progress for feature releases and recent changes by checking the [releases].

## 3. How you can help contribute to this project

We’re happy to receive pull requests for upcoming versions to fix bugs, add features and refactor code; your suggestions will help us improve our Code Editor, so we can support more young people to learn how to code. 

You must sign a Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before your PR will be merged. This a one-time requirement for this project. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) on Wikipedia.

However, you don't have to do this up-front; you can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual.

When your pull-request is created, your GitHub username is checked by a CLA bot. In the first instance the system will also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you have signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labeled as cla-signed.

Signing the CLA might sound scary but it's actually very simple and can be done in less than a minute.

**Please note:** We cannot guarantee that there’ll be capacity to review all pull requests and feature suggestions at this time, so we recommend checking the [releases] and [contacting us](mailto:web@raspberrypi.org) before raising any large-scale PRs or commits.

## 4. How we use your code and licensing

By submitting a pull request, you are agreeing to your code and contribution to this project being licensed and shared as part of [our Open Source licence][licence].
